Guide to setting up the environments in this repository so they work with gpu
on linux and tensorflow.

1. Use the yml file to create a conda env that installs the latest version of
TF (2.17.0 at time of writing) and installs the right cudatoolkit and cudnn 
libraries with this automatically.
`conda env create -f perch_conda_env.yml`

2. Activate the env
conda activate perch_conda_env

3. Install curl if not already (I am using a brand new system)
sudo apt-get install curl

4. Globally install poetry, libsdnfile1 and ffmpef which are required by Perch
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1 ffmpeg


6. Add path to bashrc, I forget if this is essential, but leaving for now incase.
nano ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
exit bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

7. Reactivate conda env
conda activate perch_conda_env

5. Now install the poetry env using the .tml file in the surfperch dir
cd surfperch
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry env use $(which python)

# Install inference-only dependencies specified in the poetry configs
poetry install

BEN got to here. Poetry trying to install. Think it worked
Though it did say in red:
Cannot install prompt-toolkit.

Next check is whether it can actually find my gpu.

Omg it worked on the tf_test.py!

Still, I don't trust anything.

Will have to try the notebooks and embed.py. Feel like they could still cause issues.

Todo tomorrow:
github all this.

Try embed.

From here on:
cd /home/bwilliams/ucl_projects/marrs_acoustics/code/surfperch
poetry shell

Guide to setting up the environments in this repository so they work with gpu
on linux and tensorflow.

1. Use the yml file to create a conda env that installs the latest version of
TF (2.17.0 at time of writing) and installs the right cudatoolkit and cudnn 
libraries with this automatically.
cd /surfperch/setup
`conda env create -f perch_conda_env.yml`

2. Activate the env and test the gpu works. It should show TF v2.17.0 and 'Num 
GPUs Available: 1'.
conda activate perch_conda_env
python tf_test.py

3. Install curl if not already (I am using a brand new system)
sudo apt-get install curl

4. Globally install poetry, libsdnfile1 and ffmpef which are required by Perch
curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
sudo apt-get install libsndfile1 ffmpeg


6. Add path to bashrc, I forget if this is essential, but leaving for now incase.
nano ~/.bashrc
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
exit bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

7. Reactivate conda env
conda activate perch_conda_env

5. Now install the poetry env using the .tml file in the surfperch dir. Note this 
has one modification to the standard Perch repo in the .tml file to set the TF 
version to 2.17.0 which is what was installed for our conda env.

5a. 
cd surfperch
poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true
poetry env use $(which python)


# Install inference-only dependencies specified in the poetry configs
poetry lock --no-update
poetry install
